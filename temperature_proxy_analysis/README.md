This repository contains the input scripts to estimate the change in SST across the Permian/Triassic, Triassic/Jurassic, and Paleocene/Eocene boundaries, as well as the output files and figures.

## Repository overview
The repository contains the following subfolders:
* **Scripts** - all of the Matlab scripts necessary to reproduce the calculations, tables, and figures.
* **MatFiles** - these are the outputs saved from the scripts.
* **GlobalFilesAndFunctions** - all of the input files and functions used to run the scripts (e.g., the file containing the Geologic Time Scale and the function to plot the time scale in figures) 
* **Figures** - pngs and pdfs of all figures produced for the manuscripts
